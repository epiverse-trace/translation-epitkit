> ### Expanding the Epi Training Kit: A South-South Collaboration for Multilingual and Localized Public Health Data Science Training Materials in Africa

Last update: Sep 09, 2025

## **BACKGROUND**

Enhancing Tools for Response, Analytics and Control of Epidemics in Latin America and the Caribbean (**TRACE-LAC**) is a project funded by the **International Development Research Centre (IDRC)** with the objective of building a **high-quality, open-source, and interoperable data toolkit** for epidemic analytics --- and fostering an engaged user community --- to support decision-makers in responding to epidemics in Latin America.

The **Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (Javeriana)** has been supported by **IDRC** to develop various activities and research products within the **TRACE-LAC** project. As part of this effort, Javeriana created the **Epi Training Kit (EpiTKit)**, an **open-access** online training strategy.

The **EpiTKit** consists of a series of modules and units for virtual training in **public health data science** and **infectious disease modeling**, aligned with the **Epiverse initiative** powered by **data.org**. To date, **10 units** have been developed in **Spanish**, tailored for audiences in **Latin America and the Caribbean**.

This new phase, developed in **partnership between Pontificia Universidad Javeriana and data.org**, expands the reach of the **EpiTKit** to **Africa** through a **South-South collaboration**, emphasizing **multilingualism** and **localism** in the **translation** and **cultural adaptation** of training materials.  The initiative aims to strengthen local capacities in data science for public health while fostering knowledge exchange between regions facing similar gaps and epidemiological challenges.

## **GENERAL OBJECTIVE**

To **translate** and **culturally adapt** the materials of the **Epi Training Kit (EpiTKit)** for the target audience in  Côte d\'Ivoire, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Togo, ensuring **linguistic clarity**, **technical accuracy**, and **cultural relevance**. This initiative embraces a **multilingual** and **localism** approach to create **context-sensitive learning experiences** that reflect **local public health realities** and strengthen regional capacities in data science for epidemic response.

This objective includes:

-   **Translating** and **adapting** the training materials from an initial set of **five units** developed by **Epiverse TRACE-LAC** into **English** and **French**, while integrating **local contexts** and region-specific examples.

-   **Reviewing** technical terminology to ensure consistency, accuracy, and **relevance to local epidemiological landscapes**.

-   **Adapting** and **producing multilingual multimedia resources** that are culturally appropriate and reflective of the diverse realities across African regions.

The five units to be translated and adapted are:

1.  **Introduction to Epidemic Theory**

2.  **General Epidemiology**

3.  **Introduction to Statistics and Probability**

4.  **Parameters**

5.  **Building a Deterministic Model**
